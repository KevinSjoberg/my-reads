# My reads

A simple application that allow you to categorize books and add new ones.

## Setup

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn start`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a
particular set of search terms, which can be found in
[SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that
will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket
Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
